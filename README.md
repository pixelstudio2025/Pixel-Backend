# Pixel-Backend
🚀 About This Project
This is my first fully custom backend, and while it is not yet complete, I am actively working on improvements. The main purpose of releasing this backend is to allow others to use it, provide feedback, and contribute to its development.

Supported Seasons
None
📌 Roadmap
Upcoming Features & Fixes:
Tournaments
Account Creation
ContentPages - News and all that
ItemShop's - With Bundles
And lots more

✅ Current Features
⚠ Note: The backend is still in early development, so functionality is limited.

Lobby Access - lobby is broken needs to be fixed
Authentication (broken) - needs to be fixed
MongoDB - Requires nothing more unless you want to mod it and make it better
These are all of our features for now, We will add lots more as days and hours go by.
